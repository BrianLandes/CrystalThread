-Quest Parts
	-Quests given in the game are procedurally generated by mixing and matching different parts together
	-Quest parts are pulled from a pool based on tags, the main ones being 'beginning', 'middle', and 'end'
	-Quest parts have multiple versions of a format, where "ask the player to retrieve an item" could have several scenarios with the details of the item or reason we need it being different
		-Key parts of the scenario could be derived, Madlibs, from past events: If the player failed to save someone once, the quest-giver could make a comment about it
		-Events could further vary by procedurally chosing 'banter' or 'development' scenes pulled from a pool based on available characters, unrestricted by location or further events
			-Banter scenes would reveal, highlight, or embellish an already existing attribute about the character(s)
			-Development scenes would add, remove, or modify a character(s) properties or relationships
	-The quest parts are built around characters, where a part requires at least one
	-A quest part has conditions that must be met in order to be chosen:
		-ie: The player must be in location with X
			-The player must have an ally that Y
	-A quest part consists of:
		-a few events (cinametic or dialog)
		-A condition or set of conditions that will end the quest part and possibly start the next one
		-'End' or resolution quest parts have only events, no conditions, some reward, and no following quest part
	-A quest part accounts for if the player simply kills the quest-giver or steals his stuff and triggers an appropriate next quest part
	-Characters are referred to by variable name and qualify or not qualify in the quest part by certain conditions, ie:
		-'main character', 'side character', 'enemy', 'ally'
		-this way one quest part can have the character do one thing, then they happen to qualify for another part in the second, building onto their development
		-Most quests will have a 'quest-giver' character
		-Characters can be a member of zero or more 'Factions'
			-A quest part can set or alter a character's faction
			-Factions are generated when needed and have good or bad relationships with other factions
			-A character's faction status can be 'claimed', 'imposter', 'confirmed', 'loyal', 'betrayed', 'traitor', 'forced'
			-A faction has a status: 'in charge', 'feared', 'extinct', 'in hiding'
	-Quest parts can 'introduce' and 'remove' characters from the game world
		-For every one added one is taken away
		-Meet a new friend or enemy
		-A friend or enemy dies
	-Quest parts must account for that character's temprol and spacial relationship with the player
		-Whether that character has been following the player for a minute or has left and is just getting back
		-NPC's relavant to the quest must decide what their general quest state is in relation to the player and the most recent events:
			-Staying, Running Away (From Player, Enemies, An NPC ), Following (the Player, Enemies, An NPC ), Going to location/item
	-A quest part 'completes' under certain conditions or the player meeting certain objectives
		-The next quest part is chosen then, accounting for the player's choices
	-A quest part probably uses one or more 'Items' where the quest part conditions require the player to obtain or find or bring back a unique key item or set amount of resource items
		-Items are procedurally pulled or created from an item list using tags and world/environment conditions
			-IE: 'unique key item' => 'Crown of the Spider King'
				-Creates a nearby location with a crown
			-'small harvestable' => '15 Lightstones'
				-Checks the surrounding area and finds a small amount of lightstones
		-The Quest State of a unique item is tracked and changed by quest parts: 'owned by player', 'stolen from player', 'destroyed'
		-The quest part can refer to it in dialog and cutscenes, giving it narrative attributes:
			-"X is the most powerful weapon in this world!"
		-An item has a size and position
			-Size is one of a few categories: pocket-sized, human-sized, house-sized, etc.
			-Position can be a location (representing that the item is loose somewhere within that place)
			-or position can be another entity, representing that that other entity owns or carries the item
	-A quest part probably uses one or more 'Locations'
		-Locations are generated when needed then recycled when appropriate
		-A location is generated or requested by a quest part by the part declaring certain tags:
			-dungeon, bats, medium-sized, 45 second run from current location
		-All locations are given a name
			-Sometimes just 'Graveyard 3'
			-Sometimes 'The Halls of the Glass Wizard'
		-The player has a map or gps that shows these locations, their names, and their relationship with on-going quest parts
		-A quest part uses locations as triggers, triggering the next part when the player enters (sometimes entering under certain conditions)
		-A location has a size and position that can be used to evaluate its spacial relativity to other locations or positions
	-A quest part adds to or modifies a global list of Plot Points
		-A plot point is a statement, fact, or axiom about the characters, the world, items, locations, relationships, or anything in the past, before or during the game
		-A plot point consists of a logical noun phrase and verb phrase, where the verb phrase is some action or something acting on the noun phrase
		-A plot point's noun phrase could be another plot point
		-A plot point can adjust what characters know or don't know (about itself or other plot points)
		-A quest parts conditions and the actions of the npcs are checked against the plot points
	-Dialog events may offer the player choices, moving into the next appropriate quest part
	-The player's initial/main quest is find each of four specific key items and return
		-The player may or may not ever return
	-A not-uncommon number of quests are 1 or 2 events long, resulting in little to nothing for reward
		-Tends to result from certain player behaviors/choices
