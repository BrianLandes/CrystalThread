Quest Part Structure
    -A quest part consists of
        -A 'trigger' which classifies it as start part, a resolution part, and/or describes the events that could trigger the quest part
            -A start part won't have a description of triggering events and are simply all possible parts when choosing a new quest
            -A quest part has only one broad way of being triggered
            -Or if a quest part is not a start or resolution, it can be 'filler' which allows it to be triggered by any one of several broad events
            -Are listed at the top of the text script in a 'Trigger' section
                -An optional 'Start', 'Resolution', 'Climax', or 'Filler' tag
                -A string describing an event
                    -no intrinsic value except to group the quest part with other quest parts that trigger from the same thing
        -Zero or more conditions that must be true in order for this quest to be valid and played
            -Finding applicable characters and items is an automatic condition
            -ie: the quest-giver must be assigned and not a good guy
            -the player must've been told about a cursed item
            -If any of the quests options have an associated cost, the player being able to afford that cost is an automatic condition
            -Non-automatic conditions are listed in the text script after the triggers in a 'Conditions' section
        -Several lists of various entities, seperated by type, that are part of the quest part:
            -Characters, items, locations
            -Identifying them using aliases
            -Pulled from the world database based on attributes
            -Can specify new, already exists, or doesn't matter
        -A list of all characters that are part of the quest part
            -Pulling them from the world database at runtime based on conditions and character attributes
            -Can specify that the character must already exist, must be new, or doesn't matter
            -The player has a special constant reference
            -The quest-giver is assigned in a start quest part and gets a special constant reference
            -An antagonist character (can be empty or reassigned) is tracked and gets a special constant reference
        -A list of zero or more items that are part of the quest part
            -A 'MacGuffin' item (can be empty or reassigned) is tracked and gets a special constant reference
            -A 'One Ring' item (can be empty or reassigned) is tracked and gets a special constant reference
        -A list of zero or more locations that are part of the quest
            -The current location is tracked and gets a special constant reference
            -The target location (can be empty or reassigned) is tracked and gets a special constant reference

        -Zero or more actions or effects to the world that occur because of the quest
            -Change the properties of an item
            -Change the attributes of a character
            -Change properties of the player, ie: resources
            -Reassign the quest-giver, antagonist, target location
            -References all entities by using the aliases listed previously in the quest part
        -Two or more options given to the player that trigger further quest parts
            -Any two connected quest parts must maintain full modularity, requiring no additional information from a previous quest part, obtaining all key information from the trigger, conditions, or reference characters
                -Obstacle : Finding a balance between broad and interesting events with no conditions and specific high condition quest parts
            -An option can have a cost associated with it that the player must be able to afford and pay in order to choose the option
                -The cost can be specific or procedurally calculated at runtime based on the player's level and resources
            -An option can have a chance for success/failure, resulting in a probability derived success quest part or failure quest part
            -If this quest part is 'filler', an option can simply mimic the trigger that preceded and called this quest part
                -This allows 'one off' events that can more or less go anywhere in the middle that easily go back to the original task at hand
            -Options are led with a meta tag, telling the player which kind of option it is, the probability or the cost in quick, obvious terms
        -A description read to the player, describing the quest and the events that unfold, filling in aliases with the specific entities name at runtime
