Time Travel
    -Time travel exists in the Crystal Thread series, but there's two kinds:
        1) Generic, loose, rpg hack-knee time travel using magic amulets and time machines
        2) Jumping from the matter half of the Crystal Thread to the antimatter half, waiting there for however long, experiencing time opposite of original, then jumping back to the matter half of the Crystal Thread, reentering at a time before you left exactly equal to the time spent in the antimatter side
    -The first kind exists but is never used for several reasons:
        -I don't want to program time travel mechanics
        -I don't want to have time travel plots
        -Almasy always says no to using it because it never works or is limited or just gets silly
            -Says using it is a rookie mistake everyone makes, just because 'going back in time to fix this' sounds like a good idea but never is, always goes wrong or just silly and all around not worth it
    -The second kind is only used the one/two times in the Crystal Thread 2
        -Involves finding a 'rip' in the Crystal Thread, which is rare to find at all given all the space and time
        -Passing through the rip converts a person into antimatter (or matter whichever) and also makes them get reborn forever
        -Not just anyone can pass through, there's a machine or special weapon required
        -Maybe the first time Almasy is in the past in the matter half, he has a chance to get back home and misses it, then spends a few life times looking for another rip and has to jump back into the antimatter half, then back again for another chance, finally getting home at what just happens to be the exact same moment that he left
