Buildable Tools and Buildings
- The player has access to a menu of various things they can build
- Tools and armor are carriable objects that appear in the player's inventory and can be used and equipped from there
    -Certain tools and armor can be crafted anywhere, while most require the player to be at a 'workbench'
    -Most tools and armor have a 3d mesh object that appears in the game world if the player drops that item or before the player has picked it up
-Structures and buildings are placed in the game world and remain in one place (more or less)
    -One of the steps when the player is choosing what to build is  where the player wants it built
    -Once the player confirms a location, a 'blueprint' version of the building is put there and the building remains 'under construction' until each of the required resources have been brought to the building
    -During and after the resources being gathered, the player must hold and activate the building for a designated amount of time, 'building' it
        -Finally placing the building there
        -Builder Bees can do this for the player
    -Certain buildings can be 'packed' and turn into carriable items that go into the player's inventory
        -While they are in this state they do not do their operations or abilities
        -They can then be 'setup' again in a new designated spot
        -Both of these processes take certain amounts of time
        -Builder Bees can do both of these in the player's place
