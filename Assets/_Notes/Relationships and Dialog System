Unit Relationships and statuses:
    -Each unit has a 'relationship' with each other unit, including the player
    -Depending on the units relationship, the units have a few ways of communicating and interacting with each other
    -The player has a few options for units that are strangers:
        -Get Attention
            -Causes the unit to either engage in a conversation with player or run away
        -Introduce Self
            -Causes the player and this unit's relationship to move to introduced with a positive respect
        -Antagonize
            -Causes the player and this unit's relationship to move to introduced with a negative respect
    -The player has a few options for units that are introduced, acquainted, or strongly familiar:
        -Ask how's it going?
            -Triggers the event if the unit has a quest or scripted event
            -Otherwise, begins a sequence of 'Chit Chat':
                -The player and the unit take turns saying things
                -The player is always given three or four options:
                    -Say something positive
                    -Say something vague
                    -Say something negative
                -The unit's response is half reacting to the option the player chose, half saying something of their own from one of those same three categories
                -Responses are pulled from a pool or generated procedurelly
                -Certain patterns of the three options have strong affects on the relationship:
                    -Saying multiple negative things in a row causes respect to decrease
                    -Saying two vague things then one positive thing is a 'joke' and increases familiarity and respect
                    -Saying one vague thing, one positive thing, and one negative thing is a 'neg' and decreases respect but increases loyalty
        -Question
        -Ask For Something
            -Exchange Goods
                -Opens up the player's inventory next to the units where the player can offer things of their own or request items from the unit
                -Based on the difference between the total values of things offered on the player's side and things requested on the unit's side: the trade is labeled as either a 'Trade' or a 'Gift' or a 'Robbery'
                -The difference between the total value of goods and the transaction status affect whether the other unit accepts or refuses the offer:
                    -A Trade for equal amounts of goods increase familiarity and respect
                    -A Gift for a large value increases familiarity, respect, and loyalty
                        -A unit might refuse a gift if they have a very low respect and loyalty towards the player
                    -A Robbery for a large value increases familiarity, but decreases respect
                        -Accepting or refusing a robbery is based on the other unit's loyalty and respect towards the player
                    -A Robbery for a small amount is more akin rude haggling
                -A declined exchange can be 'Insisted' on by the player once or twice, with another small chance of being accepted
            -Follow Me
                -The unit either accepts or refuses to temporarily follow the player
                    -Based on large values for familiarity, respect, and loyalty
                -The unit will follow the player for some amount of time or until something else comes up
            -Perform Task
                -At each point, the unit's needs and statuses are evaluated along with their current relationship to the player and a random roll determines if they accept, refuse, or sometimes hesitate
                -If the unit refuses, the dialog returns to the root and pressing the matter further has lower chances of success and reduces loyalty and respect
                -The unit either accepts or refuses to do any task for the player
                -If the unit accepts, they then await an additional form of input from the player, indicating the task
                -If the unit is incapable of performing the task they say so and refuse
                -If the unit is capable of performing the task but reluctant, they say so and hesitate
                -If the player 'Insists' while the unit is hesitating, they have a higher chance of accepting the task
                -After hesitating, the unit either accepts or refuses
                -If the unit accepts, they perform the task, their loyalty increases, and they evaluate whether it was rewarding
                    -The player can influence the reward the unit feels by saying either something positive or negative
                -Based on the reward of the task, the unit's respect towards the player changes and their likelyhood of doing that task by themselves increase or decreases
            -Join My Team
                -The unit either accepts or refuses to join the player's team
        -Antagonize

    -A relationship is unidirection, where "player -> unitA" and "unitA -> player" are two different relationships, each defining the first's values in respect to the second's
    -A relationship has float statistics that increase and decrease with various actions:
        -Short-Term Familiarity
            -[0,1) real number
            -starts at zero
            -increases with each interaction, maxing out quickly, and decays at a medium rate over time
            -higher values unlock chit chat, question, and ask for something options such as:
                -Ask about someone specific
                -Ask something personal
        -Long-Term Familiarity
            -[0,1) real number
            -starts at zero
            -increases very slowly at all times after meeting, but increases slightly faster while the units are within proximity of each other
            -higher values unlock chit chat, question, and ask for something options
                -Ask for money
                -Ask for gear
                -Ask to be companion
        -Respect
            -(-1, 1) real number value that starts at zero
            -Certain actions affect it positively, certain negatively
            -Values closer to -1 represent that this unit fears or hates the other
            -Values closer to -1 represent that this unit likes or adores the other
            -More extreme values cause Loyalty to increase faster
        -Loyalty
            -[0,1) real number that starts at zero
            -Represents how willing this unit is to do something for the other unit
            -Values closer to zero mean the unit couldn't care less
            -Values closer to 1 mean the unit would give their life for the other
            -Combined with Respect, values closer to 1 unlock the same options, just different versions:
                -Request/Demand money
                -Request/Demand do task
