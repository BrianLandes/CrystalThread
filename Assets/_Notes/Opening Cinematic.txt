Crystal Thread 2 Opening Level:
-In a lost and ancient temple deep in crazy alien woods, a warrior awakens from a deep sleep
-An ethereal wizard spirit appears, leads him through the temple and tells him about a great evil that is on its way
-They pass various heiroglyphs depicting glass dragons, chain demons, and giant three headed spiders
-The spirit explains that he is the chosen one and that he and only he can wield an all powerful weapon and save the world
-His memories begin coming back to him and he feels the weight of responsiblity but also the thrill of adventure
-The spirit gestures to the exit of the temple and says good bye/ good luck
-The enormous stone temple doors begin to open
-Sun floods in
-The crazy alien woods comes into focus
-Crazy alien structures appear off in the distance
-A dot on the horizon turns into a man running up the temple stairs
-The man is heavily armed but obviously running away from something
-He gestures to them to turn around and run
"Get back inside! Get back inside!!"
-The spirit and the warrior look at each other then back at the man
-He reaches them and tries to pull the stone doors closed behind them
-The door starts to move
-The warrior asks him whats going on, he has to go stop an ancient evil that's on its way
"Fuck your ancient evil, bro, those guys are here right now!"
-A huge, heavily armored, and fast moving space ship comes into view and nimbly maneavuers into a hover pattern
-The front of the ship spreads out (like an umbrella pointed at you), ballooning twice/three times the width of the ship, and covering most of the sky
-It flashes and changes color like a tv screen or the skin of a cuddle fish, flashing physcodelic and hypnotic patterns
-A pair of laser machine guns pop out of the belly, spin up like miniguns, and tear a trail through the side of the temple
-They focus their fire where the temple door meets the temple wall and it crumbles and falls off its hinges
-The man tumbles out of the way pushing the warrior to safety
-The spirit wizard goes into action, floating out above the temple, charging up a lightning ball, that he then launches towards the ship
-The lightning ball sails through the air, bounces off the ship's electromagnetic sheild, and creates a crater in the forest below
-The front of the ship changes patterns, more violent and jaggity, confusing the spirit wizard and mesmerizing him a little
-The minilasers on the belly retract and are swapped out for an enormous pirate ship cannon; just two weapons on a huge drum under the surface
-The ship aims and fires a large enchanted cannon ball
-Before the spirit wizard can react, the cannon ball goes through him, disintegrating him where it contacted and causing the rest of him to evaporate like paper that's burning
-his face looks mostly confused because he didn't know he could die and then he disappears entirely
-The warrior is taken aback and exclaims oh my god
"Yeah, that happens."
-The man grabs the warrior and pulls him into the temple, both of them running
-A dozen humanoids in power armor jump off the sides of the ship and jetpack down towards the temple door
-They land running and storm into the temple in tight formation with their guns up and out
-The warrior is scared but trying to be brave, saying that he's the chosen one, he has to save the world
"Yeah, join the club."
-The space marines catch up to the man and the warrior and battle it out
-The man manages to take one or two
-The warrior hits one with his magic weapon, causing an explosion against the power armor, but is overpowered by another
-The space marines shoot to kill and the warrior is blasted to pieces
-The man manages to kill another and then escape further into the temple
-He runs until he enters where we started, where the warrior woke up
-Dead end.
-He turns around and is surrounded by the soldiers
-He prepares to fight
-The soldiers part like a sea and Nero walks in
-He's maniacly excited to see the man
Nero: "And once again I have you right where I want you..."
"The Crystal Thread is a big place, how do you keep finding me?"
Nero: "Well, you're not exactly hard to follow."
-Nero smiles
-The man shrugs and readies his weapon again
-Nero wears a magic cloak that A) blocks most attacks and B) he can pull all kinds of blades out of it; he uses throwing knifes sometimes but prefers to get in close and use short swords
-Nero and the man battle it out until finally Nero knocks the weapon out of the man's hands, slices off his arm, and stabs him through the chest with a sword, pinning him to the stone wall
-Blood dribbles out of the man's mouth as Nero pulls out a knife and gets close to his face
Nero: "Any more words?"
"...I'm just going to keep coming back..."
Nero: "I'm counting on it!"
-The camera slowly pans out of the temple room as Nero raises the knife above his head, spins it around in his hand, and plunges it down into the man's chest
-He pulls it out and plunges it back in over and over and over, just thoroughly enjoying himself
-Fade to black
