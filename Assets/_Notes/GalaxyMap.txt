* The player can move around the crystal thread using the 'galaxy map'
    -Displays each world as a node with connections between them
    -The world the player starts in and each world the player visits becomes 'Discovered', at which point its full parameters are rolled and remembered
    -Undiscovered worlds are generated a certain distance in each direction from the player
    -Most worlds have a handful of human colonies
        -Saving the human colonies grants the player a small amount of passive resource income
        -Further interacting with the colony can improve or hurt the income
        -While the player is not around the colonies parameters (such as amount of humans, or position of colony) stay stagnant

    -Worlds have a handful of enemy colonies
        -While the player is around, enemy units are created and perform a specific role for the colony
        -The colony tries to maintain a certain number of each unit by generating units every so often
            -If the player is not around, these numbers are kept track of but objects aren't generated
        -A colony has a center and a radius that define where units are created and generally remain
        -A colony can move while the player isn't around
        -If all the members of a colony dies, the colony goes dormant for a length of time and/or until the player goes away, then creates more units
