[-]local path smoothing, skipping waypoints
[-]local pathing and global pathing working together
-*jump on incomplete path, no initial pausing, local and global
[-]local can connect to adjacent hextiles
-toggling local pathing
-local pathing knows about obstacles (steering)
-local pathing responds to changes (ie: obstacles changing)
-local pathing can modify global by marking tiles or edges as impassable
[-]pathing reuses appropriate data on new start or destination, local and global
-local pathing skip waypoint test uses capsule instead of quad
-if the destination is within a short distance and/or line or sight just skip pathing
